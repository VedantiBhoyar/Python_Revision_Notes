Python has no command for declaring a variable.
A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.

x = 5
y = "John"

If you want to specify the data type of a variable, this can be done with casting.
x = str(3)    # x will be '3'
y = int(3)    # y will be 3
z = float(3)  # z will be 3.0


you can get the data type of a variable with the type() function.

Variable names are case-sensitive.

A variable can have a short name (like x and y) or a more descriptive name (age, carname, total_volume).

Rules for Python variables:

A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
A variable name cannot start with a number
A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)
A variable name cannot be any of the Python keywords.


Python allows you to assign values to multiple variables in one line:
x, y, z = "Orange", "Banana", "Cherry"
print(x)
print(y)
print(z)
